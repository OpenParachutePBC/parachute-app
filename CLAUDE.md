## Current Development Focus

**🚧 Active Feature**: Auto-Pause Voice Recording with Noise Suppression (Nov 7, 2025)

**Status**: 📋 Planning complete, 🎯 Starting implementation

### Goal

Port [RichardTate](https://github.com/lucianHymer/richardtate)'s proven auto-pause and noise suppression system to Parachute:

- **Auto-detect silence** - No manual pause button needed (1s silence → auto-segment)
- **Remove background noise** - RNNoise removes keyboards, fans, traffic, TV
- **Intelligent segmentation** - Natural speech boundaries, no mid-sentence cuts
- **Better transcription** - Clean audio → better Whisper accuracy

### Implementation Strategy

**Maximum code reuse**: Port ~1,040 lines of battle-tested Go algorithms to Dart + FFI bindings for RNNoise C library

**Three-week phased delivery**:

- **Week 1**: Pure Dart ports (VAD, Resampler, Chunker) → Auto-pause working
- **Week 2**: RNNoise FFI integration → Noise suppression added
- **Week 3**: UI polish, settings, testing → Ship to users

## Project Overview

**Parachute**: Second brain app with Claude AI via Agent Client Protocol (ACP) + integrated voice recorder.

**Stack:** Go backend (Fiber, SQLite) + Flutter frontend (Riverpod)

**Architecture:** `Flutter → HTTP/WebSocket → Go → JSON-RPC → ACP → Claude`

**Data Architecture:**

- All data in configurable vault (default location varies by platform)
- `{vault}/{captures}/` - Voice recordings (subfolder name configurable via Settings)
- `{vault}/{spaces}/` - AI spaces with CLAUDE.md system prompts (subfolder name configurable)
- Each space has `space.sqlite` for structured knowledge management
- **Platform-specific defaults:**
  - macOS/Linux: `~/Parachute/`
  - Android: External storage `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.../files/Parachute`
  - iOS: App Documents directory
- **Compatibility:** Works with Obsidian, Logseq, and other markdown vaults

**App Structure:** Three main tabs in bottom navigation:

- **Spaces** - Browse AI spaces and conversations with Claude
- **Recorder** - Voice recording with Omi device support and local Whisper transcription
- **Files** - Browse entire `~/Parachute/` directory structure

## CRITICAL Bug Preventions

### ⚠️ #1: Flutter Type Casting (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**NEVER do this:**

```dart
❌ final List<dynamic> data = response.data as List<dynamic>;  // CRASHES!
```

**ALWAYS do this:**

```dart
✅ final Map<String, dynamic> data = response.data as Map<String, dynamic>;
   final List<dynamic> spaces = data['spaces'] as List<dynamic>;
```

**Why:** API endpoints return `{"spaces": [...]}`, not `[...]`

### ⚠️ #2: ACP Protocol Requirements

```go
✅ ProtocolVersion: 1           // int, not string
✅ McpServers: []MCPServer{}    // REQUIRED, even if empty (no omitempty)
```

**Method names:** `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/update`
**Parameters:** Use `camelCase` (`sessionId`, `cwd`), not `snake_case`

### ⚠️ #3: Flutter Riverpod

**All widgets using providers MUST be wrapped in `ProviderScope`:**

```dart
runApp(ProviderScope(child: ParachuteApp()));
```

### ⚠️ #4: Authentication

Backend tries `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var, then falls back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json`

### ⚠️ #5: File Paths

- Vault location is configurable and platform-specific (see Data Architecture)
- Use `FileSystemService` to get correct paths - NEVER hardcode paths
- Backend expects absolute paths to vault root
- Frontend may use relative paths in API calls
- Always convert appropriately in backend handlers

### ⚠️ #6: Subfolder Names

- Default subfolder names are `captures/` and `spaces/`
- Users can customize these via Settings → Subfolder Names
- Use `FileSystemService.capturesPath` and `FileSystemService.spacesPath`
- NEVER assume hardcoded subfolder names in code

---

## Git Workflow

**DO NOT commit before user testing!**

1. Make code change
2. Tell user what changed
3. Ask user to test
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Ask permission to commit
6. Commit only after approval

**Why:** Avoids messy history with reverts and bug-filled commits.

**Important:** Always use `git --no-pager` when running git commands in bash (prevents pager from blocking output).

---

## Common Quick Fixes

```bash
# Port in use
lsof -ti :8080 | xargs kill

# Flutter clean build
cd app && flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Rebuild backend after Go changes
cd backend && make build

# Check Parachute folder structure
ls -la ~/Parachute/
```

**Flutter package name:** `package:app/...` (not `parachute`)

**WebSocket not streaming?** Check client calls `subscribe(conversationId)` after connecting.

## Space CLAUDE.md System Prompt Strategy

Each space has a `CLAUDE.md` file that serves as a **persistent system prompt** for conversations in that space. This is a core part of Parachute's second brain architecture.

### Purpose

- Define the context and purpose of the space
- Guide Claude's behavior and responses
- Reference available knowledge (linked notes, projects, etc.)
- Set expectations for how to use space-specific data

### Dynamic Variables (Planned)

When space.sqlite feature is complete, system prompts will support:

- `{{note_count}}` - Number of linked notes in this space
- `{{recent_tags}}` - Most used tags (last 30 days)
- `{{recent_notes}}` - Last 5 referenced notes
- `{{notes_tagged:X}}` - Count of notes with specific tag
- `{{active_projects}}` - List of projects with status=active

### Example: Project Space

```markdown
# Parachute Development Space

You are assisting with development of Parachute, a second brain app.

## Context

This space tracks development discussions, architecture decisions, and feature planning.

## Available Knowledge

- Linked Notes: {{note_count}} voice recordings and written notes
- Recent Topics: {{recent_tags}}
- Active Features: {{active_projects}}

## Guidelines

- Reference architecture docs when discussing design
- Link new insights to this space for future reference
- Connect ideas across different development discussions
```

### Best Practices

1. **Make context explicit** - State what the space is for
2. **Reference available knowledge** - Show what exists in the space
3. **Set behavioral guidelines** - How should Claude behave here?
4. **Enable discovery** - Encourage Claude to suggest connections
5. **Maintain continuity** - Reference past conversations and notes

## Development Principles

1. **Local-First** - User owns their data, always
2. **Privacy by Default** - No tracking, no ads
3. **Open & Interoperable** - Standard formats (markdown, SQLite)
4. **One Folder** - All data in `~/Parachute/`, portable and open
5. **Cross-Pollination** - Notes link to multiple spaces, ideas flow
6. **Thoughtful AI** - Enhance thinking, don't replace it

---

## Quick Reference: File System Layout

**Note:** Vault location and subfolder names are configurable. Default structure shown below.

```
{vault}/                                # Configurable location (default: ~/Parachute/)
├── {captures}/                         # Configurable name (default: captures/)
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md         # Transcript
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.wav        # Audio
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json       # Metadata
│
└── {spaces}/                           # Configurable name (default: spaces/)
    ├── space-name/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md                   # System prompt
    │   ├── space.sqlite                # 🆕 Knowledge metadata
    │   └── files/                      # Space-specific files
    │
    └── another-space/
        ├── CLAUDE.md
        ├── space.sqlite
        └── files/
```

**Customization:** Users can:

- Change vault location via Settings → Parachute Folder → Change Location
- Rename `captures/` and `spaces/` subfolders via Settings → Subfolder Names
- Point vault to existing Obsidian/Logseq vaults for interoperability

## First-Time Setup (Onboarding)

Parachute includes a 4-step onboarding flow that runs on first launch:

### Step 1: Welcome

- Explains vault-based architecture
- Shows Obsidian/Logseq compatibility
- Displays current vault location

### Step 2: Whisper Model Setup

- Download local Whisper model for transcription
- Three model sizes: Tiny (75 MB), Base (142 MB), Small (466 MB)
- Users can skip and download later
- Background downloads supported

### Step 3: Gemma Model Setup (Optional)

- Download Gemma 2B model for AI-powered title generation (5.4 GB)
- **Requires HuggingFace Token** (models are gated)
- Token input UI with show/hide toggle
- Users can skip if not using AI features
- Background downloads supported

### Step 4: Advanced Features

- Explains Omi device integration
- Can be enabled later in Settings

### Implementation Details

- Onboarding state stored in `SharedPreferences` (`parachute_has_seen_onboarding`)
- Download progress persists across screens (can start in onboarding, monitor in Settings)
- All downloads are optional and can continue in background
- HuggingFace token saved securely via `StorageService`

**Code locations:**

- `app/lib/features/onboarding/screens/onboarding_flow.dart` - Main coordinator
- `app/lib/features/onboarding/screens/steps/` - Individual step widgets
- `app/lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Post-onboarding model management

---

## When Working on Features

1. **Read the feature doc first** - Check `docs/features/` for detailed specs
2. **Update todos** - Use the TodoWrite tool to track implementation steps
3. **Follow the plan** - Feature docs have implementation phases
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't build everything before testing
5. **Update docs** - Keep feature docs current as you learn
6. **Ask before committing** - Follow git workflow above

---

## Documentation Structure & Guidelines

### Root Directory (Keep Minimal!)

Only these four essential files should live in the root:

- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **CLAUDE.md** - This file - developer guidance for Claude Code
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and technical decisions
- **ROADMAP.md** - Current focus and future feature queue

### Documentation Organization (`docs/`)

All other documentation lives in `docs/` with clear categorization:

**Active Development:**

- `docs/features/` - Feature specifications and implementation plans
- `docs/implementation/` - Current implementation details and guides
- `docs/architecture/` - Detailed architecture documents (ACP, database, etc.)
- `docs/development/` - Development workflow, testing guides

**Reference & History:**

- `docs/completed/` - Historical milestones and session summaries
- `docs/research/` - Research notes, feasibility studies, explorations
- `docs/archive/YYYY-MM/` - Outdated docs (keep for reference)

**Component-Specific:**

- `backend/CLAUDE.md` - Backend-specific context
- `app/CLAUDE.md` - Frontend-specific context
- `app/lib/features/*/CLAUDE.md` - Feature-specific context

### Documentation Best Practices

**Creating New Documentation:**

1. **Default location**: `docs/` subdirectory, not root
2. **Choose the right category**: features, implementation, research, etc.
3. **Link from CLAUDE.md**: If it's important, reference it here
4. **Use descriptive names**: `git-sync-implementation.md` not `sync-stuff.md`
5. **Date when relevant**: `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix for time-sensitive docs

**Maintaining Documentation:**

1. **Archive, don't delete**: Move outdated docs to `docs/archive/YYYY-MM/`
2. **Update references**: Check CLAUDE.md and other docs for broken links
3. **Consolidate duplicates**: Merge similar docs rather than creating new ones
4. **Keep root clean**: Only essential files; everything else moves to `docs/`

**Session Summaries & Milestones:**

- Go to `docs/completed/` with descriptive names
- Reference major ones from ROADMAP.md's completed section
- Don't clutter root with progress tracking
