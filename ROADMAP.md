# Parachute Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: November 10, 2025

---

## Current Focus: Space SQLite Knowledge System

**Status**: 🔜 Next Up
**Priority**: P0

The auto-pause feature is complete! Next up: resuming the Space SQLite Knowledge System that was deferred when we pivoted to local-first recording.

**See**: [docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md](docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md)

### Recent Major Achievement: Auto-Pause Voice Recording ✅

**Completed**: November 10, 2025

Automatic silence detection with intelligent noise suppression is now **fully functional**:

- ✅ VAD (Voice Activity Detection) - RMS energy-based speech detection
- ✅ SmartChunker - Auto-segment on 1s silence
- ✅ OS-level noise suppression (echoCancel, autoGain, noiseSuppress)
- ✅ High-pass filter (80Hz cutoff) - Removes low-frequency rumble
- ✅ Visual debug overlay with real-time audio graphs
- ✅ Settings toggle for auto-pause and debug mode
- ✅ 116 comprehensive tests covering all components

**Audio Pipeline**: `Mic → OS Suppression → High-Pass Filter → VAD → SmartChunker → Whisper`

**Implementation Docs**:

- [docs/implementation/noise-filtering-phase1.md](docs/implementation/noise-filtering-phase1.md) - Current implementation
- [docs/implementation/auto-pause-branch-audit.md](docs/implementation/auto-pause-branch-audit.md) - Complete audit
- [docs/implementation/auto-pause-vad-implementation.md](docs/implementation/auto-pause-vad-implementation.md) - Research

**Result**: Hands-free journaling with natural pauses. No manual pause button needed!

### Recent Major Achievement: Git-Based Sync ✅

**Completed**: November 6, 2025

Multi-device synchronization using Git is now **fully functional**. All data in `~/Parachute/` syncs via GitHub with:

- ✅ Auto-sync after save/update/delete operations
- ✅ Manual sync with UI indicator showing file counts
- ✅ Periodic background sync (every 5 minutes)
- ✅ Settings persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Complete local-first architecture (no backend required for recordings)

**See**: [docs/implementation/github-sync-implementation.md](docs/implementation/github-sync-implementation.md)

### Strategic Architecture

The **local-first architecture** means:

- Git handles sync (not custom backend)
- Backend only for agentic AI tasks (future)
- Standard Git workflows (familiar to developers)
- E2E encrypted repos for privacy
- Works with any Git hosting (GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted)

**Next Feature** (Space SQLite) is **deferred** until UI polish is complete.

## Near-Term Roadmap (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

### 🔜 Backend Git Integration

**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Deferred until frontend Git sync is stable
**Timeline**: December 2025

- Backend uses `go-git` library for Go
- Pull before running agentic AI tasks
- Commit AI-generated content
- Push results back to repo
- Verify frontend/backend on compatible commits

**Why**: Enable backend to work on same Git-synced data

### 🔜 Space SQLite Knowledge System

**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Deferred until Git sync is complete
**Timeline**: January 2026

Link captures to spaces with space-specific context while keeping notes canonical.

- Backend database service for note linking
- Frontend UI for linking recordings to spaces
- Space note browser
- Chat integration (reference notes in conversations)
- CLAUDE.md template variables

**See**: [docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md](docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md)

**Why**: Make recordings more useful by connecting them to AI conversation contexts

### 🔜 Smart Note Management

**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Backlog

### Custom Space Templates

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Concept

Create templates for common space types:

- Project spaces (tasks, milestones, issues)

**Why**: Jumpstart space setup, encourage best practices

### Advanced Search & Query

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Concept

- Natural language queries ("farming notes from last month")

- ❌ Ads or attention-harvesting mechanics
- ❌ Required cloud sync (always local-first)
- ❌ Lock-in formats (use markdown, standard SQLite)
- ❌ Cryptocurrency/blockchain integration
- ❌ AI training on user data without explicit consent

---

## Decision Log

- ✅ Git replaces backend sync infrastructure (backend now only for agentic AI)
- ✅ Chose `git2dart` over pure Dart implementation for performance
- ✅ GitHub Personal Access Tokens for initial auth (SSH keys later)
- ✅ Auto-commit strategy: one commit per recording
- ✅ Frontend and backend sync to same Git repository

**Local-First Recording (Nov 5)**

- ✅ Live transcription UI with manual pause-based chunking
- ✅ Eliminated backend dependency for recording/storage
- ✅ All recordings save to `~/Parachute/captures/` (markdown + audio)
- ✅ Non-blocking UI initialization for instant screen navigation
- ✅ Complete final segment transcription before save

**Vault System (Nov 1)**

### October 2025

- ✅ Decided on space.sqlite approach over centralized knowledge graph
- ✅ Chose to keep notes canonical in captures/ (not duplicate)

- ✅ Prioritized local-first over cloud-first architecture

### September 2025

- ✅ Selected Go + Fiber for backend (over Node.js/Python)
- ✅ Selected Flutter for frontend (over React Native/Swift)
- ✅ Chose ACP protocol for Claude integration
- ✅ Decided on SQLite for MVP (PostgreSQL for later)

## How to Contribute Ideas

Have an idea for Parachute? Here's how to propose it:

1. **Check existing docs** - Review this roadmap and feature docs
2. **Open an issue** - Describe the problem and proposed solution
3. **Discuss trade-offs** - What's gained? What's the cost?
4. **Prototype if possible** - Code speaks louder than words
5. **Iterate** - Feedback shapes the best features

---

## Roadmap Principles

1. **Local-First**: User owns their data, always
2. **Privacy by Default**: No tracking, no ads, no surveillance
3. **Open & Interoperable**: Use standard formats, enable export
4. **Thoughtful AI**: Enhance thinking, don't replace it
5. **Sustainable Pace**: Quality over speed, avoid burnout
6. **User-Driven**: Build what users need, not what's trendy
